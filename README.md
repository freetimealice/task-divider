Chore Counselor

No one looks forward to cleaning the toilet bowl or scrubbing the bathtub, but we can at least make it fun by instilling a bit of luck and fairness into your chore assignment system.

This app is meant to be played between two users who share responsibilities.

The app does the heavy computing of assigning chores by taking three factors into consideration:

Ranking: The higher you ranked a chore, the more likely you'll win that chore!

Time: Each chore takes different amounts of time to complete. Both users should be allocated a fairly similar amount of chores, not by number of chores, but by how long it takes to complete all the assigned chores.

Randomness: It's no fun without a bit of randomness involved! May luck be on your side!

You have the option to save your chores to your Google Tasks, making it easy to keep track of your to-dos.

For reminders of your weekly chore, navigate to your personal user page. That page visualizes which chores you spend the most time on, across ALL weeks. Separately, you can also see the chores you've been assigned for the latest week.
